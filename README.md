# iff2png

This is iff2png for Amiga. Convert IFF images (including ILBM, DEEP, RGB8, RGBN, FAXX, PBM, ACBM) to PNG format with iff2png.

*A web, suddenly*

*Forty years meditation*

*Minds awaken, free*

**amigazen project** uses modern software development tools and methods to update and rerelease classic Amiga open source software. Upcoming releases include a new AWeb, and a new Amiga Python 2.

Key to the amigazen project approach is ensuring every project can be built with the same common set of development tools and configurations, so we created the ToolKit project to provide a standard configuration for Amiga development. All *amigazen project* releases will be guaranteed to build against the ToolKit standard so that anyone can download and begin contributing straightaway without having to tailor the toolchain for their own setup.

This software is Free and Open Source Software distributed on terms described in the documentation, particularly the file LICENSE.md

amigazen project philosophy is based on openness:

*Open* to anyone and everyone	- *Open* source and free for all	- *Open* your mind and create!

PRs for all of amigazen project releases are gratefully received at [GitHub](https://github.com/amigazen/). While the focus now is on classic 68k software, it is intended that all amigazen project releases can be ported to other Amiga-like systems including AROS and MorphOS where feasible.

## About ToolKit

**ToolKit** exists to solve the problem that most Amiga software was written in the 1980s and 90s, by individuals working alone, each with their own preferred setup for where their dev tools are run from, where their include files, static libs and other toolchain artifacts could be found, which versions they used and which custom modifications they made. Open source collaboration did not exist then as we know it now. 

**ToolKit** from amigazen project is a work in progress to make a standardised installation of not just the Native Developer Kit, but the compilers, build tools and third party components needed to be able to consistently build projects in collaboration with others, without each contributor having to change build files to work with their particular toolchain configuration. 

All *amigazen project* releases will release in a ready to build configuration according to the ToolKit standard.

Each component of **ToolKit** is open source and like *make* here will have it's own github repo, while ToolKit itself will eventually be released as an easy to install package containing the redistributable components, as well as scripts to easily install the parts that are not freely redistributable from archive.

## Requirements

- Amiga or Amiga-compatible computer with latest operating system software

## Usage

iff2png converts IFF (Interchange File Format) bitmap images to PNG format. It supports all major IFF image formats including ILBM, PBM, RGBN, RGB8, DEEP, ACBM, YUVN, and FAXX. It will automatically choose the optimal profile for the PNG file based on the source file's properties.

### Basic Syntax

```
iff2png SOURCE TARGET [OPTIONS]
```

### Arguments

- **SOURCE** - Input IFF image file (required)
- **TARGET** - Output PNG file (required)

### Options

- **FORCE** - Overwrite existing output file without prompting
- **QUIET** - Suppress normal output messages (errors will still be displayed)
- **OPAQUE** - Keep color 0 opaque instead of transparent. By default, iff2png honors the ILBM specification where palette index 0 can be transparent. Use this option to preserve legacy behavior where black (color 0) is always visible.
- **STRIP** or **NOMETADATA** - Prevents any metadata text (copyright, author, annotations) from the source IFF file being included in the target PNG

### Examples

Convert an IFF image to PNG:
```
iff2png source.iff target.png
```

Convert with forced overwrite and quiet mode:
```
iff2png source.iff target.png FORCE QUIET
```

Convert preserving black as opaque:
```
iff2png source.iff target.png OPAQUE
```

Convert without copying metadata:
```
iff2png source.iff target.png STRIP
```

### Supported IFF Formats

- **ILBM** (InterLeaved BitMap) - Standard Amiga bitmap format with interleaved bitplanes. Supports HAM (Hold And Modify), EHB (Extra Half-Brite), and various bitplane counts. Also supports 24-bit ILBM (deep ILBM with 24 bitplanes for true-color RGB, where bitplanes 0-7 represent Red, 8-15 represent Green, and 16-23 represent Blue).
- **PBM** (Packed BitMap) - Similar to ILBM but with packed pixels (one byte per pixel) instead of bitplanes (N.B. this is not the same as NetPBM)
- **RGBN** - RGB format with N planes (true-color with separate RGB channels).
- **RGB8** - RGB 8-bit format (24-bit color, 32-bit with alpha).
- **DEEP** - High bit-depth format for professional graphics.
- **ACBM** (Amiga Continuous BitMap) - Format with separate alpha channel data in an ABIT chunk.
- **YUVN** - YUV color space format for broadcast television (CCIR-601-2 standard). Stores luminance (Y) and color-difference signals (U, V) in separate chunks. Supports various YUV modes (400, 411, 422, 444, and lores variants). *Note: YUVN support is planned but not yet implemented.*
- **FAXX** - Facsimile image format using ITU-T T.4 compression (Modified Huffman, Modified READ, Modified Modified READ).
- **ILBM Framestore** - NewTek VideoToaster's Framestore proprietary extensions to ILBM

### Output Information

When not in quiet mode, iff2png displays detailed information about the conversion:

- IFF source format, file size, dimensions, bit planes, compression method, and masking
- PNG target color type, bit depth, palette entries, transparency settings
- Conversion summary with file sizes and compression ratio
