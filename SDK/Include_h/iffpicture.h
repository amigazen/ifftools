 *
 * InitIFFPictureasDOS() - Initializes the IFFPicture to operate on DOS streams.
 *                         Allocates and initializes an internal IFFHandle structure.
 *                         The iff_Stream field must be set by the caller after
 *                         calling Open() to get a BPTR file handle.
 *
 * OpenIFFPicture() - Prepares an IFFPicture to read or write a new IFF stream.
 *                    The direction of I/O is given by rwMode (IFFF_READ or
 *                    IFFF_WRITE). The IFFPicture must have been initialized
 *                    with InitIFFPictureasDOS() and iff_Stream must be set
 *                    to a valid BPTR file handle before calling this function.
 *                    Returns 0 on success or an error code on failure.
 *
 * CloseIFFPicture() - Completes an IFF read or write operation by closing the
 *                    IFF context. The IFFHandle structure is freed. The file
 *                    handle (iff_Stream) is NOT closed - the caller is
 *                    responsible for closing it with Close(). This matches
 *                    iffparse.library behavior where CloseIFF() doesn't close
 *                    the file handle.
 *
 * ParseIFFPicture() - Parses the IFF file structure and reads property chunks
 *                    (BMHD, CMAP, CAMG, etc.) into the IFFPicture structure.
 *                    Must be called after OpenIFFPicture(). Returns 0 on

/* Chunk Reading Functions - following iffparse.library pattern
 *
 * These functions read specific IFF chunks from an opened IFFPicture.
 * They use iffparse.library's FindProp() to locate stored property chunks
 * that were declared with PropChunk() during ParseIFFPicture().
 *
 * ReadBMHD() - Reads the BMHD (Bitmap Header) chunk and stores it in the
 *              IFFPicture structure. This chunk contains image dimensions,
 *              bitplane count, compression type, masking, and other metadata.
 *
 * ReadCMAP() - Reads the CMAP (Color Map) chunk containing palette data.
 *             The palette consists of RGB triplets (r, g, b, r, g, b, ...).
 *             For 4-bit palettes, colors are automatically scaled to 8-bit.
 *
 * ReadCAMG() - Reads the CAMG (Amiga Viewport Modes) chunk containing
 *              display mode flags such as HAM, EHB, LACE, HIRES, etc.
 *
 * ReadBODY() - Reads the BODY chunk header information. The BODY chunk
 *              contains the actual image pixel data. This function stores
 *              the chunk size and position for later reading during decoding.
 *
 * ReadABIT() - Reads the ABIT (Alpha Bitmap) chunk header information.
 *              Similar to ReadBODY() but for alpha channel data in ACBM
 *              format images.
 *
 * Metadata Chunk Reading Functions:
 *
 * ReadGRAB() - Reads the GRAB chunk (hotspot coordinates). Returns a pointer
 *              to a Point2D structure in IFFPicture's memory, or NULL if not
 *              found. Pointer is valid until FreeIFFPicture() is called.
 *              Library owns the memory - caller must NOT free.
 *
 * ReadDEST() - Reads the DEST chunk (destination merge information). Returns
 *              a pointer to a DestMerge structure in IFFPicture's memory, or
 *              NULL if not found. Pointer is valid until FreeIFFPicture() is
 *              called. Library owns the memory - caller must NOT free.
 *
 * ReadSPRT() - Reads the SPRT chunk (sprite precedence). Returns a pointer to
 *              a UWORD in IFFPicture's memory containing the precedence value,
 *              or NULL if not found. Precedence 0 is the highest (foremost).

 *              the memory - caller must NOT free.
 *
 * ReadCRNG() - Reads the CRNG chunk (color range, first instance). Returns a
 *              pointer to a CRange structure in IFFPicture's memory, or NULL
 *              if not found. Multiple CRNG chunks can exist; this returns the
 *              first one. Pointer is valid until FreeIFFPicture() is called.
 *              Library owns the memory - caller must NOT free.
 *
 * ReadAllCRNG() - Reads all CRNG chunks. Returns a pointer to a CRangeList
 *                 structure containing count and array pointer into IFFPicture's
 *                 memory, or NULL if not found. Pointers are valid until
 *                 FreeIFFPicture() is called. Library owns the memory - caller
 *                 must NOT free.
 *
 * ReadCopyright() - Reads the Copyright chunk. Returns a pointer to a
 *                   null-terminated string in IFFPicture's memory, or NULL if
 *                   not found. Pointer is valid until FreeIFFPicture() is

 *                    NULL if not found. Multiple ANNO chunks can exist; this
 *                    returns the first one. Pointer is valid until
 *                    FreeIFFPicture() is called. Library owns the memory -

/* Getter Functions - following iffparse.library pattern
 *
 * These functions provide read-only access to IFFPicture data. They return
 * values from the internal structure without exposing implementation details.
 *
 * GetIFFHandle() - Returns a pointer to the internal IFFHandle structure.
 *                 This allows the caller to set iff_Stream after calling
 *                 InitIFFPictureasDOS() and before calling OpenIFFPicture().
 *                 Returns NULL if the IFFPicture is not initialized.
 *
 * GetWidth/Height/Depth() - Return basic image dimensions and bitplane count
 *                           from the BMHD chunk. Return 0 if BMHD is not loaded.
 *
 * GetFormType() - Returns the IFF FORM type identifier (e.g., ID_ILBM, ID_PBM).
 *                 This identifies the image format variant.
 *
 * GetVPModes() - Returns the Amiga viewport mode flags from the CAMG chunk.
 *                The returned ULONG contains flags such as vmHAM, vmEXTRA_HALFBRITE,
 *                vmLACE, vmHIRES, etc. Returns 0 if CAMG chunk is not present.
 *                This is the raw CAMG value that can be used with BestPictureModeID()
 *                or for direct mode matching.
 *
 * GetBMHD() - Return pointer to the internal BMHD structure.
 *             This pointer remains valid until the IFFPicture is freed.
 *             Returns NULL if not loaded.
 *
 * GetYCHD() - Return pointer to the internal YCHD structure (YUVN format).
 *             This pointer remains valid until the IFFPicture is freed.
 *             Returns NULL if not loaded or not YUVN format.

 * GetIFFColorMap() - Return pointer to the internal IFFColorMap structure
 *                    (palette data). This pointer remains valid until the
 *                    IFFPicture is freed. Returns NULL if not loaded.
 *                    Note: Renamed from GetColorMap to avoid conflict with
 *                    graphics.library function.
 *
 * GetPixelData() - Returns a pointer to the decoded pixel data buffer.
 *                  The data format depends on the image type (RGB, indexed, etc.).
 *                  Returns NULL if image has not been decoded.
 *
 * GetPixelDataSize() - Returns the size in bytes of the decoded pixel data.
 *                      This is useful for calculating buffer sizes.
 *
 * HasAlpha/IsHAM/IsEHB/IsCompressed() - Boolean queries about image properties.
 *                                       These are determined during format analysis.
 *
 * GetMultipaletteChunkId() - After load (DecodePicture path has run
 *          ReadILBMMultipalette), returns which multipalette chunk drives indexed
 *          row palettes: MAKE_ID('S','H','A','M'), MAKE_ID('P','C','H','G'),
 *          MAKE_ID('C','T','B','L'), or 0 if none. Precedence matches decode:
 *          SHAM over PCHG over CTBL. Compare with MAKE_ID; do not assume numeric
 *          values across library versions.
 *
 * IsMultipaletteActive() - TRUE iff GetMultipaletteChunkId() != 0.
 *
 * GetPaletteIndices() - After Decode(), NULL or pointer to w*h bytes of
 *          original palette indices (library-owned; valid until FreeIFFPicture).
 *          Absent when not applicable; multipalette RGB images may still omit this.
 *
 * GetImageInfo() - Returns a pointer to an IFFImageInfo structure containing
 *                  all core image properties (dimensions, format, flags, etc.)
 *                  in a single structure. This is useful for getting a complete
 *                  overview of the image without making multiple function calls.
 *                  The structure is allocated statically and remains valid until
 *                  the next call to GetImageInfo() or until the IFFPicture is freed.
 *                  Returns NULL if the picture is invalid or not loaded.

/* Decoding Functions
 *
 * Decode() - Decodes the IFF image data into an internal format suitable
 *            for further processing. Handles all IFF formats (ILBM, PBM,
 *            RGBN, RGB8, DEEP, ACBM, FAXX) and compression methods
 *            (ByteRun1, Modified Huffman, Modified READ, etc.). Also handles
 *            special modes like HAM and EHB. Must be called after ParseIFFPicture().
 *            Returns 0 on success or an error code on failure.
 *
 * DecodeToRGB() - Decodes the IFF image and converts it to RGB format.
 *                Allocates a buffer containing 24-bit RGB data (r, g, b, r, g, b, ...)
 *                suitable for writing to PNG or other RGB-based formats.
 *                The caller is responsible for freeing the returned buffer.
 *                Returns 0 on success or an error code on failure.
 *                Note: The returned rgbData may point to picture->pixelData,
 *                which is freed by FreeIFFPicture(). Do not free it separately.
 *
 * DecodeToBitMap() - Decodes the IFF image and creates an Amiga BitMap structure
 *                    ready for display. The BitMap is allocated using AllocBitMap()
 *                    with the specified modeID. Supports both planar (bitplane) and
 *                    chunky (8-bit per pixel) display modes.
 *                    
 *                    For planar modes: Converts RGB data directly to bitplanes.
 *                    For chunky modes: Uses WriteChunkyPixels() if available (V40+),
 *                    otherwise falls back to direct conversion.
 *                    
 *                    The caller is responsible for freeing the BitMap using
 *                    FreeBitMap() when no longer needed.
 *                    
 *                    Parameters:
 *                    - picture: IFFPicture structure (must be decoded)
 *                    - modeID: Display mode ID (use BestPictureModeID() to find)
 *                    - friendBitmap: Optional friend bitmap for efficient allocation
 *                      (NULL if not needed)
 *                    
 *                    Returns: Pointer to allocated BitMap, or NULL on failure.
 *                    Must be called after Decode() or DecodeToRGB().
 *
 * DecodeToRastPort() - Decodes the IFF image and creates an off-screen RastPort
 *                      with attached BitMap. This is a convenience function that
 *                      calls DecodeToBitMap() and then initializes a RastPort.
 *                      
 *                      The RastPort is allocated and initialized with InitRastPort().
 *                      The BitMap is attached and ready for rendering operations.
 *                      
 *                      The caller is responsible for freeing the RastPort using
 *                      FreeRastPort() when no longer needed. This will also free
 *                      the attached BitMap.
 *                      
 *                      Parameters:
 *                      - picture: IFFPicture structure (must be decoded)
 *                      - modeID: Display mode ID (use BestPictureModeID() to find)

 *                        (NULL if not needed)
 *                      
 *                      Returns: Pointer to allocated RastPort, or NULL on failure.
 *                      Must be called after Decode() or DecodeToRGB().
 *
 * FreeRastPort() - Frees a RastPort and its attached BitMap created by
 *                  DecodeToRastPort(). This function properly cleans up both
 *                  the RastPort structure and the BitMap memory.
 *                  
 *                  Parameters:
 *                  - rp: RastPort to free (must have been created by DecodeToRastPort())

 *                   (HAM, EHB), compression, and alpha channel presence.
 *                   This information is used to optimize PNG encoding.
 *                   Must be called after ParseIFFPicture() and before decoding.
 *                   Returns 0 on success or an error code on failure.
 *
 * GetOptimalPNGConfig() - Determines the optimal PNG encoding configuration
 *                         for the IFF image. This includes color type, bit depth,
 *                         palette (if indexed), and transparency settings.
 *                         The configuration is stored in the provided PNGConfig
 *                         structure. The caller is responsible for freeing any

 *                         
 *                         The opaque parameter controls transparency handling:
 *                         - If FALSE (default): Honors transparentColor from BMHD
 *                           when masking == mskHasTransparentColor, including
 *                           index 0 (per ILBM specification).
 *                         - If TRUE: Skips transparency for index 0 to keep
 *                           black visible (legacy behavior).
 *                         
 *                         Returns 0 on success or an error code on failure.
 *
 * BestPictureModeID() - Determines the best Amiga screenmode for displaying
 *                      the IFF image. Uses graphics.library BestModeIDA() to
 *                      find a ModeID that matches the image properties.
 *                      
 *                      If a CAMG chunk is present, it uses those viewport
 *                      mode flags (HAM, EHB, LACE, HIRES) as requirements.
 *                      If no CAMG chunk exists, it infers requirements from

/* IFF Form Type IDs
 *
 * These constants identify the different IFF image format variants.
 * ID_FORM is defined in iffparse.h and is the container for all these types.
 *
 * ID_ILBM - InterLeaved BitMap: Standard Amiga bitmap format with interleaved
 *           bitplanes. Supports HAM, EHB, and various bitplane counts.
 *
 * ID_PBM  - Packed BitMap: Similar to ILBM but with packed pixels (one byte
 *           per pixel) instead of bitplanes. Simpler format, less common.
 *
 * ID_RGBN - RGB with N planes: True-color format with separate RGB channels.
 *           N indicates the number of bits per channel.
 *
 * ID_RGB8 - RGB 8-bit: True-color format with 8 bits per RGB channel
 *           (24-bit color, 32-bit with alpha).
 *
 * ID_DEEP - Deep format: High bit-depth format for professional graphics.
 *           Supports more than 8 bits per channel.
 *
 * ID_ACBM - Amiga Continuous BitMap: Format with separate alpha channel data
 *           in an ABIT chunk. Similar to ILBM but with transparency support.
 *
 * ID_FAXX - Facsimile Image: Fax image format using ITU-T T.4 compression
 *           (Modified Huffman, Modified READ, Modified Modified READ).
 *           Typically black and white images for fax transmission.
 *
 * ID_YUVN - YUV format: MacroSystem VLab YUV format for broadcast television.
 *           Supports CCIR-601-2 standard for PAL and NTSC. Stores Y (luminance)
 *           and optional U, V (color difference) channels. Supports various
 *           subsampling modes (411, 422, 444) and grayscale (400).
